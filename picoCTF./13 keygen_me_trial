this challenge needs you to focus on the lines where the hints of flags could be found.
And these are the infos you can gather about the flag

>>> key_part_static1_trial = "picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_"
>>> key_part_dynamic1_trial = "xxxxxxxx"
>>> key_part_static2_trial = "}"
>>> key_full_template_trial = key_part_static1_trial + key_part_dynamic1_trial + key_part_static2_trial

and the function "check_key"

there you will see... The "key_part_dynamic1_trial" is actually some random chars of the SHA256 hashing of "username_trial" 
Which was assigned as "FRASER"

now decode the chars and you will get this flag.

FLAG - picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_ ..... }
