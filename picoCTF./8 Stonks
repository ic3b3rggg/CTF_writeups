Trying to overflow the buffer yields no results. Hence this is not a buffer overflow exploit.

on line 93, "print(user_buf);" is vulnerable due to format string vulnerablility.

inputting a lot of "%x" gives a hex encoded string. We can use CyberChef to decode it to ascii char from the Hex value.

However, the flag is still not visible. But the structure of it is visible. Identify the correct boundaries where the flag must lie.
In this case it should be readable characters. (such as "o" and curly braces)
and remove all other junk from the input except that area.

Swap the Endianness of the input to 4 bytes word length.

The Flag will mostly be visible. Now remove all other non readable chars {such as "." etc.}

FLAG - picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_.....}
