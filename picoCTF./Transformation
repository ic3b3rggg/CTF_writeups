A code is given informing about how the flag was encrypted in python

Reverse Engineer the code in python can be done by the following code.

import math
flag = "灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸彤㔲挶戹㍽"
actual_flag = ""

for i in range(0,len(flag)):
    second_char = chr(ord(flag[i])%128)                   // as the ord of each char of the flag should be between 0 to 127
    first_char = chr(math.floor((ord(flag[i]) >> 8)))     // bitwise operation reversal and flooring (flooring is unnecessary but done for good measure)
    actual_flag = actual_flag + first_char + second_char  // each char of the encrypted flag corresponds to two chars of the actual flag as the for loop used for encryption works in pairs

print(actual_flag)

FLAG - picoCTF{16_bits_inst34d_of_8_......}
